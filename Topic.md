## Topic Commitment

My proposed topic is a research paper on the otter saga that has taken place in the midwest. This includes fluctuating populations, reintroduction, ecological impact, economical impact, and the direction that the otter is going in the U.S. Many love the otter and many despise the otter. I hope to convince my audience that the otter is needed and there are specific ways to manage otter populations without wiping them out once again.
