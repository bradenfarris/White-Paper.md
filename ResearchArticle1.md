My topic will be wildlife related, and if at all possible I would like to link it to my trail cam study I have worked on over the last few months. One of the animals repeately captured on camera has been the North American River Otter. River otters were once nearly wiped out in Missouri, but after being reintroduced thirty years ago, their population has rebounded and some are even concerned that they have too high of numbers. Generally the people who dislike otters are those with a river based business, where otters overun the river and mess up docks and eat fish. 

This article discusses the factors that determine population of otters in the midwest and where they will thrive based on these factors. 

Keywords I found were: otter, population, factors, Missouri, river systems, water quality, farms, riparian zones, wooded rivers, wildlife ecology
