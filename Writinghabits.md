## 1. Writing Habits?

My writing habits are both good and bad. I tend to write most of the time all in one sitting. This is tiring and could lead to a drop off in production, but I tend to take breaks during long periods of time. I am also not a very good typer, so being a mediocre typer could be a bad habit. I also tend to write with an outline in mind, as this helps with organization and getting the bigger picture in mind. 

## 2. Improve Habits?

The habits that I can improve upon is stretching out my papers. Instead of working on a paper over a couple of days, I could stretch it out over a week, that way I do not get fatigued and I have fresher ideas. My typing habits could improve as well. I need to practice typing so that I may become a better and more efficient typer, and this may speed up my writing process. 

## 3. Strengths?

The habit I consider a strength is when I tend to make outlines for a paper. I get all of my main points and arguments set in stone before I write, this way I know my focus and where I am going with my paper. Another strength is that I get very involved with my paper by choosing a topic I care about. This makes writing much easier and more meaningful if I have a good reason to be writing.
