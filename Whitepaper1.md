# The North American River Otter: From Near Extirpation to Over Population

## Introduction

For the past three months I have participated in a camera trapping research project. A mammal that the cameras continually caught was the river otter on the shores of Lake Taneycomo. This piqued my interest, since I was not even aware of a population of river otters on Taneycomo. It turns out there is a long saga surrounding the river otter, not just in the Ozarks, but in the entire midwest. My audience is the people who have encountered otters in some way or another, whether it be good or bad, but my hope is to make you understand the otter and their effects, not just understand that they are cute and/or destructive, depending on your view. I am hoping to educate my audience about the river otter, from an ecological and economical perspective, and maybe even convince you that the river otter is a needed and deserving creature in our rivers and streams and that there is a way that they can be managed that can benefit both them and us humans. 

## Scientific Description of the River Otter

The North American River Otter (*Lontra canadensis*) is in the weasel family (Mustelidae) which is in the order Carnivora according to the **Missouri Department of Conservation Otter fact page**. The river otter has webbed feet, long tapered tails, thick oily fur, layers of warmth producing fat, long wiskers for sensory purposes, and a keen sense of smell. They are powerful swimmers and can be submerged underwater for over three minutes. 


## Conservation History

According to the **Missouri Department of Conservation Missouri River Otter Saga page**, there were only 35-70 river otters alive in the state of Missouri in 1980, all of them located in the wetlands of the far southeast boothill region. Since the restocking efforts of the department took place, there are now well over 15,000 otters in the state, located in every county of Missouri. During an eleven year period 845 otters were released, and the population has exploded since then. The otter conservation efforts has truly been a success story, but now there are thoughts that it has been too successful. *These issues will be addressed shortly.*

The current status of the river otter in Missouri is estimated at around 10,000 otters, which is the goal of MDC. The population peaked at 18,000, which is when angler complaints were at an all time high. Now since trapping has been implemented for over 15 years, population of river otters has declined and anglers do not complain as much. 

## Wildlife Policy of Missouri River Otters

According to the **Missouri Department of Conservation Otter Control page**, the otter is classified as a furbearer and therefore can be trapped during the trapping season dates. The code also states that any harmful otter can be shot or trapped not during furbearer season without a permit. This code refers to private landowners whose property is being harmed or whose personal health is in danger due to otters. Out of season permits are most used by farmers who have ponds, where otters come in and can wipe out a population quickly, or for business owners along a river where otters are detrimental to business. 

## Economic Value of Otters

The economic value of otters can be traced directly back to their pelts, like any other furbearer. According to a **News Tribune Article "A Whole Otter Trouble"**, there is actually quite a large market for otter pelts. Tyler Brown, a game warden of Missouri, says a fur market for otters creates a natural otter control which utilizes trapping, and it helps keep in check the population. **The MDC Missouri Otter Saga page** relays that trapping numbers of otters has increased due to the pelt market value. In 2006 there were 3,000 otters trapped in Missouri, with the market at a high of $40-$120 per pelt. That equates to $120,000-$360,000 circulating in Missouri alone for otter pelts.
