# The North American River Otter: From Near Extirpation to Over Population

## Introduction

For the past three months I have participated in a camera trapping research project. A mammal that the cameras continually caught was the river otter on the shores of Lake Taneycomo. This piqued my interest, since I was not even aware of a population of river otters on Taneycomo. It turns out there is a long saga surrounding the river otter, not just in the Ozarks, but in the entire midwest. My audience is the people who have encountered otters in some way or another, whether it be good or bad, but my hope is to make you understand the otter and their effects, not just understand that they are cute and/or destructive, depending on your view. I am hoping to educate my audience about the river otter, from an ecological and economical perspective, and maybe even convince you that the river otter is a needed and deserving creature in our rivers and streams and that there is a way that they can be managed that can benefit both them and us humans.
