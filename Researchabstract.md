## Research Abstract

My white paper research paper will focus on the North American River Otter. Over the last three months I have collected telling data of the river otter population on lake Taneycomo. My camera project has produced numerous photos of otters and it has piqued my interest in the species as a whole. It turns out otters are not viewed favoriably by certain individuals due to there destructive nature to some river businesses. But as far as conservation goes, they have been an immense success in the Ozarks since their reintroduction in the 1980's. My goal is to give a research paper that uses scientific research, government policies, business and market value, social/public opinion, and pure data numbers. 

My audience will be the wildlife managers who set harvest policies for otters and the business owners who have grown weary of the otter for their detrimental behavior towards their business. 

My call to action is that otters are an extreme conservation success and that the otters detrimental habits can be overcome. I want to convince my audience to continue to manage the otter for ecological and economical purposes.
